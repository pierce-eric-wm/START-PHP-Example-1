# START-PHP-Example-1

This small and VERY rough project will show some of the basics regarding data transmission through PHP and MySQL. Inside the database folder is the database_schema.sql file which contains the SQL you can use the recreate the exact database and table I am using in the examples.

Please remember that these examples are one of many way of doing these kinds of operations and that there are indeed much better and safer/more robust methods out there. This project is for demonstration purposes only. It gives you the basic idea which you can then build upon and improve.
